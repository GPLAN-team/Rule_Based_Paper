"""Biconnectivity Augmentation Module

This module allows the user to check if the graph is biconnected and can
make it biconnected.

This module contains the following functions:
    * is_biconnected - returns a boolean representing whether the graph is biconnected or not.
    * get_cutvertices - returns a list of cut vertices(a.k.a articulation points) present in the graph.
    * get_biconnected_components - Returns a generator of sets of vertices, one set for each biconnected component present in the graph. 
        (Advised to be converted to list for any other operations)
    * same_component - returns a boolean representing whether the given 2 nodes are in the same biconnected component or not.
    * biconnect - returns the edges to be added to make graph biconnected.
