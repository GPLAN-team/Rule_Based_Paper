"""Rectangular Dual Generation Module

This module allows user to generate rectangular dual for a
given PTPG.

This module contains the following functions:

    * get_rectangular_coordinates - populates rectangular
                                    coordinates
    * get_direction - populates rectangular coordinates for
                      irregular rooms
    * construct_dual - constructs rectangular dual for PTPG.
    * construct_floorplan - constructs dimensioned rfloorplan for PTPG.
    * get_dimensions - returns dimension of each room.
