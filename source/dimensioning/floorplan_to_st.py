Dimensioning Module
This module allows user to obtain optimised dimensions for height and width of each room from their inputs. This module handles symmetry constraints,
aspect ratio constraints as well as plot size constraints.

This module contains the following functions stored in seperate files:
    * floorplan_to_st - Takes user inputs and converts them into encoded matrix form of horizontal and vertical st graphs.
     					Calls solve_linear and convert_adj_equ_sym.
	* convert_adj_equ_sym - Converts encoded st graphs into linear equations.
    * solve_linear - Takes few user inputs along with the encoded horizontal and vertical st graphs to give optimized dimensions .
